Many types of internal hernias have been defined: paraduodenal, small bowel mesentery-related, greater omentum-related, lesser sac, transverse mesocolon-related, pericecal, sigmoid mesocolon-related, falciform ligament, pelvic internal, and Roux-en-Y anastomosis-related. An internal hernia is a surgical emergency that can develop into intestinal strangulation and ischemia. Accurate preoperative diagnosis is crucial for appropriate management. Multidetector computed tomography (CT), with its thin-section axial images, high-quality multiplanar reformations, and three-dimensional images, currently plays an essential role in preoperative diagnosis of internal hernias. The diagnostic approach to internal hernias at multidetector CT includes detecting an intestinal closed loop, identifying the hernia orifice, and analyzing abnormal displacement of surrounding structures and key vessels around the hernia orifice and hernia sac. At each step, multidetector CT can depict pathognomonic findings. A saclike appearance suggests an intestinal closed loop in several types of internal hernias. Convergence, engorgement, and twisting of mesenteric vessels in the hernia orifice can be seen clearly at multidetector CT, especially with use of multiplanar reformations. For definitive diagnosis of an internal hernia, analysis of displacement of anatomic landmarks around the hernia orifice is particularly important, and thin-section images provide the required information. Detailed knowledge of the anatomy, etiology, and imaging landmarks of the various hernia types is also necessary. Familiarity with the appearances of internal hernias at multidetector CT allows accurate and specific preoperative diagnosis.
