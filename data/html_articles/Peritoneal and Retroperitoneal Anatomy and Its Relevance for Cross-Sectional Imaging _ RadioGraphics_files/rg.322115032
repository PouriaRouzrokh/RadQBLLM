However, infectious, inflammatory, neoplastic, and traumatic processes frequently involve the peritoneal cavity and its reflections; thus, it is important to identify the affected peritoneal ligaments and spaces. Knowledge of these structures is important for accurate reporting and helps elucidate the sites of involvement to the surgeon. The potential peritoneal spaces; the peritoneal reflections that form the peritoneal ligaments, mesenteries, and omenta; and the natural flow of peritoneal fluid determine the route of spread of intraperitoneal fluid and disease processes within the abdominal cavity. The peritoneal ligaments, mesenteries, and omenta also serve as boundaries for disease processes and as conduits for the spread of disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","context":{"all":{"count":23613071,"mean":10.38899936430783,"rank":2661892,"pct":88,"higher_than":20956820},"journal":{"count":2648,"mean":10.385167673716008,"rank":653,"pct":75,"higher_than":1995},"similar_age_3m":{"count":157441,"mean":7.760996474870085,"rank":16149,"pct":89,"higher_than":141302},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":15,"mean":7.969333333333335,"rank":6,"pct":66,"higher_than":10}},"authors":["Temel Tirkes","Kumaresan Sandrasegaran","Aashish A.
